## Project
My CRUD
### Goal
Resolve this challenge in the best way possible considering good practices, clean code (uncle Bob) and tests.
### Requirements
Create an API json endpoint with the following considerations:
- An endpoint: CRUD for an item (imagine it's a store of any kind you like) with name, description, value and currency
 - Logic: Consume an external API to get USD dollar change into EUROS (https://exchangeratesapi.io/) to respond with the corresponding currency.
- Integrate it with a relational database of your preference using Sequelize 
- Framework -> Express 
- Handle errors (specially 40x 50x ones)
- Handle basic security (this is not authentication)
- Unit tests with Mocha and Sinon or Jest. (Using mocks and spies)
- Use and handle environment variables.
- Integration tests (optional)
- Authentication (optional)
- Anything else you think will make it production ready (optional)
### Recomendations
- Do not do the challenge with one commit. 
- Push the challenge to your personal repository
- Everything should be in English (variable names, comnments etc)
